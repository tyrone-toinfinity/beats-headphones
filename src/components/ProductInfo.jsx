        <sup>2</sup>Testing conducted by Apple in April 2021 using preproduction
        Beats Studio Buds and Charging Case units and software paired with
        iPhone 11 Pro Max units and prerelease software. The playlist consisted
        of 358 unique audio tracks purchased from the iTunes Store (256-Kbps AAC
        encoding). Volume was set to 50% and Active Noise Cancellation and
        Transparency were turned off. Testing consisted of full Beats Studio
        Buds battery discharge while playing audio until the first Beats Studio
        Buds stopped playback. With Active Noise Cancellation turned on,
        listening time was up to 5 hours. Battery life depends on device
        settings, environment, usage, and many other factors.
